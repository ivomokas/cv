        <p class="hi-there">I get a kick out of problem-solving as I have a natural tendency to think of ways to reshape methods and trim processes in order to achieve better solutions.</p>

          <h3>UX is a way of life</h3>
        <p>Throughout my life, I have integrated several projects that needed enhancements or even to be built from the ground up. Having the habit of adopting a bird view and following the workflow of things, gives me a better perspective to find what the user really needs.  </p>
